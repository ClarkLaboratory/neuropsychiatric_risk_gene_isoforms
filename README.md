Companion data and scripts to our risk gene isoform manuscript (2025), pre-print available: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.22.24303189v2

The data files contain the results presented in our paper for 31 risk and 2 non-risk genes and can be uploaded to IsoVis to view RNA isoforms (GTF) and expression levels (TPM): https://isomix.org/isovis/ 

R scripts used to count risk gene data from curated GWAS Catalog data (Additional File 5) and for combing all risk gene TPM counts and performing PCAs (Additional File 6) are also provided.
